# Experiment log

Rule: every number here traces to a file in `experiments/` or `runs/`, or to a command output
quoted in the entry. If it can't be traced, it doesn't go in.

## Entry template
```
## EXP-NNN — <short title>
- Date:            YYYY-MM-DD
- Git SHA:         <commit>  (dirty? yes/no)
- Config:          configs/<file>.yaml
- Seed(s):         
- Command:         
- Hardware state:  AC power? Energy Mode? other apps open? ambient notes
- Tokens / steps:  
- Metrics:         <metric> = <value>   (source: <file>:<line or key>)
- Peak memory:     measured <x> GiB vs estimate <y> GiB  (gap: …)
- Throughput:      <tok/s> median over <window>  (source: …)
- Observations:    only claims supported by the metrics above
- Caveats:         single seed? proxy? burst vs sustained? tokenizer differences?
```

## EXP-000 — Feasibility probe (PROXY)
- Date: 2026-09-22
- Git SHA: none (pre-first-commit)
- Command: `experiments/feasibility_tput_proxy.py` (HF `LlamaForCausalLM` stand-in, not Syrinx code)
- Details and raw numbers: [`feasibility-2026-09-22.md`](feasibility-2026-09-22.md)
- Headline: 125M bf16 mb8 at 6,674 tok/s (burst) → 2.5B tokens in ~4.3 days; 50M at 13,362 tok/s.
- Caveats: **proxy**, a 15-step burst, not sustained, not our implementation. Gate 6a re-measures.
